This is a game that I wrote in 2003.
It is now 2017, and I found it on my harddrive.
I can no longer compile it, because it used an ancient development version
of clanlib.
I am putting it on github in case I ever get round to getting it going again.


Original README from 2003:

This is ClanKars.
Work in progress by Graham Keeling, graham.keeling@btinternet.com
Feel free to mail me your comments.
ClanKars borrows the CAImageManipulation class from Trophy -
http://trophy.sourceforge.net/ (thanks to Andrew Mustun!)

So far, a s w d control player 1, with left shift and left ctrl controlling
weapons
and the arrow keys control player 2, with right shift and right ctrl for
the weapons

p pauses whilst in the game, and esc will exit.

It's still under heavy development, but looking quite good!

To compile, just run 'make' from within the top level directory and then run
./clankars
